This is my current FVWM3 configs and scripts, and
anything does that runs on this desktop.  The desktop
I want to use anyway.

If you find anything that doesn't work for you if you
try this out yourself in a VM even, let me know what
doesn't work for you so I can fix it.  It would be nice
to make it more plug-n-play.

                                    Cheers, 
                                    rabbitear!
